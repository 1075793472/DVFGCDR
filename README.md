# Install
To use DSHCNet you must make sure that your python version is greater than 3.7. If you donâ€™t know the version of python you can check it by:
```python
python
>>> import platform
>>> platform.python_version()
'3.7.13'
```
# Train and test DVFGCDR
1.Download the data from the Baidu Cloud link. \
2.Unzip the downloaded data (.zip file) from Baidu Cloud, and copy all files from the unzipped folder to the same level directory as the main.py file in the repository.
